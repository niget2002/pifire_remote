# pifire_remote
Scripts and apps for monitoring pifire remotely

## Objective
This project hopes to provide a front end for pifire to monitor the smoker remotely.

The primary use of the application will be through microPython running on an ESP32 device with a small TFT screen and 3 buttons. The device will mimic the TFT and 3 buttons that are on the front of the pifire.

There will be a second directory containing python scripts. These scripts will be used for testing parts of the app as needed.
